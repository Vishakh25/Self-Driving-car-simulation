A self-driving car simulation using `JavaScript`, `AI`, and `neural networks` focuses on creating an environment where autonomous vehicles can navigate and make decisions. Using JavaScript, tools to simulate `2D` or `3D` environments with roads, traffic, and obstacles. The car's decision-making is powered by neural networks, with `Reinforcement Learning` (RL) algorithms enabling the car to improve its navigation through trial and error. `Convolutional Neural Networks` (CNNs) can process visual data, helping the car recognize objects, pedestrians, and road signs. Path planning algorithms such as `A*` or `Deep Q-Networks` (DQN) are used to decide the best route.JavaScript can manage user interactions and environmental changes. This simulation helps to mimic real-world challenges faced by autonomous vehicles, training the AI to handle dynamic driving conditions effectively.
